# Paper-Piano
Paper Piano is an interactive application that lets you "play" a piano printed with green discs using your computer's camera. It combines computer vision (OpenCV), MediaPipe Hands for finger tracking, and Pygame for sound playback. Ideal for demos, prototypes of tangible interfaces, and digital art projects.
